this is a to do list app using corona sdk widgets
it also uses my own privete ye framework that simplefies corona sdk use.

this to do list uses a text file as db to keep things simple, perhaps 
i will create one with sqlite support.

the list is a table view,it has crud operations: add,view, edit and delete.
its a great example for beginers in corona sdk devlopment.


there is an apk for testing on mobile.
